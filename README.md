# rock-paper-scissors
My submission for the third assignment in The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. I was tasked to create an interactive game of rock paper scissors, in which the user is playing against a computer, using JavaScript. After each round, the winner is announced, and after 5 rounds, the final winner and score are announced. All results are logged onto the console.
